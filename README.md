# EV Charging System

 Overview

The EV Charging System project aims to address the growing demand for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in India. This mobile application leverages the Google Maps API to provide users with an intuitive platform to locate various charging options. Unlike traditional systems, our app uniquely integrates three types of charging points: public, private, and semi-public.

 Features

- Comprehensive Charging Network: Access a wide range of charging points, including public, private, and semi-public chargers.
  
- Real-time Information: Utilize the Google Maps API to track and display real-time information on charger availability, active hours, and charging speeds.

- User-Friendly Interface: The app is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy to navigate and use for EV owners.

- Booking System: Users can book a slot in advance for public, semi-public, or private chargers, ensuring a reserved charging spot.

 Objectives

1. Enhanced Charging Availability: Develop a user-friendly mobile application to enhance charging availability for EV owners.
  
2. Optimized User Experience: Provide a seamless and convenient EV charging experience through an intuitive interface and real-time information.

3. Promoting Sustainability: Encourage EV adoption and sustainable transportation practices by connecting public and private charging stations.
